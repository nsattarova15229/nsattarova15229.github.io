        <h2>Our Learning Process</h2>

        <p><strong>First:</strong> We went through a Codecademy course and learned the principles of front-end development. This provided us with the foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to start building our projects.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Second:</strong> Each of us worked on our individual parts of the project, contributing to different aspects such as design, functionality, and structure.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third:</strong> We helped each other by reviewing each other's work, fixing mistakes, and improving the project together. This collaborative effort ensured that the final project was polished and functional.</p>

        <p>Through this process, we not only developed technical skills but also learned the importance of teamwork. We gained valuable insights and tips from each other, improving our work and learning a lot along the way.</p>
