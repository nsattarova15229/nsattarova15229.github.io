    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      We are a team of four from ADA University, and as part of our SITE1101 course, we were assigned to create a website. While some might see this as just another course requirement to earn a grade, for us, it is an invaluable opportunity to enhance our collaboration and front-end development skills—perhaps even to build something worthy of adding to our portfolios.

      Despite all the challenges and bugs, this website is the result of our teamwork and dedication. What makes this project unique is that it symbolizes not just an academic task but also our reunion and the beginning of a new chapter. Throughout the project, we prioritized each member's contribution, hard work, and, most importantly, the knowledge we gained along the way.

      Our team name and logo also carry significant meaning. The inspiration for our group name comes from our logo. Where the initials of each member are arranged in a way that depicts the three visible peaks (one is hidden :D) of the mountain which can be associated with "Beşbarmaq dağı" (Five Finger Mountain). For this reason, we have dubbed it to "Dördbarmaq dağı" (Four Finger Mountain), symbolizing our cooperation, resilience, and unity.
