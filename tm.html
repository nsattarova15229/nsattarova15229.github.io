            <div class="description">I am Najima Sattarova, first year student from ADA University and currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics. My purpose in entering to this university and degree is to broaden my knowledge in Mathematics which will create a decent base for pursuing my further degrees (Computational Physics and Astrophysics). Besides mathematics I am also huge fan of coding which sometimes melts my brain (that is why I like it). Apart from my studies, I have a hobby of crocheting, playing Indie and Logic Games (e.g. INSIDE, while True: Learn) which helps me to relieve from daily stress..</div>

            <div class="description">Hello, my name is Mammad Hasanov, and I am a first-year student at ADA University, majoring in Computer Engineering. I chose this field because I can truly see myself growing in it, and I am fascinated by the possibilities technology can offers. Computers have always excited me, and I enjoy learning how they work and how they can be used to solve complex problems. Beyond technology, I am passionate about cars and the engineering that goes into their design. My favorite car is Mercedes, as I admire their craftsmanship, precision, and innovation. I believe that both technology and automobiles share the common thread of advancing human capabilities and improving lives. In the future, I hope to combine my love for computers with my interest in the automotive industry.</div>
